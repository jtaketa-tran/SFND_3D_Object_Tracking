# 3-D Object Tracking

### Project Description

The objective of this project is to estimate the time-to-collision for a self-driving car using sequences of camera and lidar data from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite. For the camera images, we detect objects using Deep Learning (YOLO) and track those objects given inputs from keypoint detection, description and matching. We associate regions in a camera image with Lidar points in 3D space using the YOLO bounding boxes as a reference.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* OpenCV >= 4.1
  * This must be compiled from source using the `-D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON` cmake flag for testing the SIFT and SURF detectors.
  * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level project directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./3D_object_tracking`.
